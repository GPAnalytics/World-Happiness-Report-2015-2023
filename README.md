# World Happiness Report 2015-2023

## Overview and Goals
 The World Happiness Report, a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, utilizes Gallup World Poll data to annually rank countries based on life evaluations. Life evaluations are measured using the Cantril ladder, where individuals rate their own lives on a scale from 0 to 10. The report considers variables such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption to explain variations in happiness.

This report has become a global reference for understanding the factors that contribute to happiness and has sparked international conversations about the importance of well-being in policy-making.
